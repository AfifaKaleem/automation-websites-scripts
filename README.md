I developed and maintained core backend systems and RESTful APIs that powered real-time features such as livestreaming, direct messaging, and user interactions. I integrated third-party APIs from platforms e.g.: YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, Snap Chat, X.com to automate complex social media workflows and content ingestion. To ensure scalability and reliability, I implemented caching, load balancing, and performance optimization strategies, maintaining a stable platform and delivering seamless user experiences in high-traffic environments.
